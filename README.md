## Sports Quiz

The sports quiz application is a quiz game which will display questions for the user to answer. All sports based so it is targeted and probably would appeal more to sports fans but can be enjoyed by anyone. This project gave me the chance to work with an API and this is how the users scores and username are kept and this is updated on an excel spreadsheet once they have completed the quiz. I created the sports quiz as a way to make a fun and entertaining game that anyone can enjoy. The game will become more and more entertaining as questions will be added in the future. This will keep the game entertaining and users coming back to play.
